   pc: `This is my PC. I spend most of my time coding here — Python, C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript are my go-to languages. 
  I’ve built games, AI models, and full-stack apps on this very screen. 
  You can peek at my work on <a href="https://github.com/sristtt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!`,

  "cs-degree": `That’s my CS degree in progress! I’m pursuing B.Tech in CSE-AI at IGDTUW (2023–2027) with a GPA of 8.10 so far. 
  It’s been a great journey learning AI, full-stack dev, and solid CS fundamentals.`,

  "sofa-table": `That’s my sofa. When I’m not coding, I relax here and sometimes draft content. 
  Fun fact: I once published a podcast review for Finivesta, summarizing personal finance insights for students. 
  Not everything I do is just tech — I like exploring creative work too!`,

  tv: `That’s my TV! I usually watch tech creators and tutorials to keep learning. 
  Recently, I’ve been inspired by game dev and AI videos. 
  They fuel my ideas for projects like <a href="https://github.com/sristtt/Metroidvania-Game-.git" target="_blank">my 2D platformer</a> and AI-driven apps.`,

  bed: `This is where I rest — and dream up new ideas. 
  A lot of my projects (like Raahi for smart truck routing) were sparked while I was lying here, unable to sleep until I scribbled them down!`,

  resume: `Here’s my resume! <a href="https://sristtt.github.io/Srishti_Portfolio/" target="_blank">Check it out?</a>  
  I’ve interned as a Python-ML developer, worked on AI-powered full-stack applications, and contributed to published research. 
  If you’ve got an interesting opportunity, reach out at <a href="mailto:sudhakarsrishti29@gmail.com">sudhakarsrishti29@gmail.com</a>.`,

  projects: `Some of my projects are really close to my heart:  
  - <a href="https://github.com/sristtt/MockMate.git" target="_blank">MockMate</a>: AI mock interview prep tool.  
  - <a href="https://github.com/sristtt/Metroidvania-Game-.git" target="_blank">Metroidvania Game</a>: Pixel-style 2D platformer.  
  - <a href="https://github.com/sristtt/Raahi.git" target="_blank">Raahi</a>: AI + IoT for smarter truck routing.`,

  library: `These are my books! I’ve collected a bunch on AI, web dev, and algorithms. 
  Truth be told, I probably haven’t finished them all (who does?). 
  But combined with my coursework and projects, they’ve given me a strong foundation.`,

  exit: `If you’d like to leave Srishti’s portfolio, you can close the tab.
